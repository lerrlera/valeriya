## Assignment Description
This is my personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its purpose is to showcase information about me in a résumé-style format, including my skills, background, experience, and education. I created a navigation link that connects the main portfolio page to the visualization page. This repository contains:
- `index.html` A homepage with resume-style content (about, education, skills, experience, contact)
- `visualizations.html` A visualization portfolio page with **two SVG visualizations generated using JavaScript**:
  - One SVG data visualization
  - One creative SVG art piece
- `style.css` This file handles the styling of my webpages.
- `main.js` This file is used for adding basic JavaScript interactivity.
- `vis.js` This file contains the code for generating SVG drawings and visualization.
- `README.md` This file explains the purpose of the website, including what technologies are used and how the site can be navigated.
